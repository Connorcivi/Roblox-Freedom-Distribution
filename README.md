# Rōblox Filtering Disabled

Adapted from the [Rōblox Filtering Disabled](https://jetray.itch.io/roblox-filtering-disabled) project by Jetray, et al. I built my own launcher and stripped down the focus of my work to August 2018 and October 2022 builds of Rōblox. As of 2023-07-01, I still need to add the actual Rōblox builds.

## Server

py launcher/main.py -v 2018M server -rp 2005 -wp 80 -p "C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\Roblox Hacked Place Database 2 - MrManchot\Your Age on ROBLOX.rbxl"
```

# Player
